> **React Framework with Type-Safe Routing & Server Functions.**

`ev` is a modern React framework built for speed, type-safety, and simplicity. It leverages the best-of-breed primitives from the TanStack ecosystem and adds seamless React Server Functions (RSF) with a Hono-based API server.

## ⚡ Features

- **Type-Safe Routing**: Built on [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).
- **Isomorphic Data Fetching**: Powered by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).
- **Server Functions**: Use `"use server"` to define server-side logic callable as standard async functions.
- **Dynamic Server Discovery**: Auto-detects server functions in real-time — no manual configuration or imports.
- **Pluggable Transport**: Configurable `ServerTransport` interface for custom protocols and libraries.
- **Runtime-Agnostic Server**: Hono-based server with Runner API for Node, Edge, or Bun.
- **Configurable Builds**: Plugin options for `appFactory`, `runner`, and `setup` imports.
- **Single-Config Build**: Harmonized client/server builds via Webpack Child Compilers.
- **Unified CLI**: Scaffold and manage projects with the `ev` command.
