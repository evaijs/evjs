# ev

> **React Framework with Type-Safe Routing & Server Functions.**

`ev` is a modern React framework built for speed, type-safety, and simplicity. It leverages the best-of-breed primitives from the TanStack ecosystem and adds a seamless integration for React Server Functions (RSF) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

## ⚡ Features

- **Type-Safe Routing**: Built on [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).
- **Isomorphic Data Fetching**: Powered by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).
- **Server Functions**: Use `"use server"` to define server-side logic that can be called like standard async functions.
- **Unified CLI**: Scaffold and manage your projects with the `ev` command.
- **Modern Build**: Optimized with SWC and Webpack.
